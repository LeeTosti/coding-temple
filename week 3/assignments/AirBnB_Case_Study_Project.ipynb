Within Manhattan, entire homes/apartments are the most popular units to book.\n","- It appears that AirBnB may have a maximum amount that hosts can charge per night as 4 of our top 5 are $10,000 a night.\n","- Around 10,000 units are most likely new or inactive as they do not have any reviews and their availability could be 365 meaning no one has yet to book with them, or zero availability, which could mean that they never opened their availability up or do not currently want someone staying at their listing.\n","- There appears to be two types of hosts. For example we have Wanda in Brooklyn has the highest number of reviews with zero availability. This could be due to location and the unit itself being inviting. However, as shown below, the top 10 hosts with multiple locations have well over 2,000 units they rent out. The top host with multiple locations has 67,689 units.
