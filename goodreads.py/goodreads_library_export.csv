Below is my honest review.**<br/><br/>I really loved this story! Agnarr's Teacher was a complete surprise when I read it and I have recommended it to everyone I know. So to say I was looking forward to this is an understatement. I normally don't like second books that follow the same romance as the first book but this is a clear exception! There is so much more for Piper and Agnarr to go thru in this book and neither character regresses, which is something that bothers me about other sequel romance books. You will not find that here. They grow even more as couple as they step into their new roles which is why I think this works so well. It also sets up the other characters for future books in the series, which has me even more excited to come back to this world. <br/><br/>I recently described Agnarr's Teacher as ""cozy smut"" and I will officially add Agnarr's Jarlin to the subgenre as well.

Dead Romantics was one of my top three books I read in 2022. And The Seven Year Slip is now one of my top books of 2023. Within the first 5 pages, Ashley creates a magical, mysterious, and evocative world. I got the same tingling feeling reading this book that I did with Dead Romantics and it was such a treat when **spoiler** a certain man named Benji makes an appearance. A lot of romance writers create their own universes where all the characters from all their books live in the same world, but Ashley makes it feel new and exciting. I don't know any other author out there doing what she does. Cannot wait for her next book!",true,,1,0

Okay now let's get into the review!<br/><br/>This is the third Christina Lauren book I have read.i read Unhoneymooners last year and I read The Soulmate Equation about a week ago. I actually enjoyed Soulmate Equation better than Unhoneymooners so when I got this arc I was so excited because I couldn't wait to learn more about Fizzy! This book had me laughing from the very beginning to the very end! It was so wonderful and I read it in just over a day. By far my favorite Christina Lauren book so far! I have read other dating show books (Charm Offensive, One to Watch) and I was worried this would be exactly the same. But this book does a great job of not feeling like every other Bachelor/Bachelorette themed book. <br/><br/>I highly recommend to any romance reader! Fizzy and Connor are definitely two of my favorite romantic leads now ",,,1,0

If I finish the book, it atleast held my interest to warrant 2.5 or 3 stars. But after the major(?) conflict resolved around the 75% mark, I wasn't sure why I was still reading anything. I thought ""well maybe this is a book where the last 10% is a preview of their next book."" NOPE! Listen, I enjoyed the spice. But if I have to hear ""We are vipers"" or ""I am a viper"" again, I will pull my hair out. I stopped reading with 55 pages left to read. And you know what? I don't think I missed anything. I'm not sure who K.A. Knight has editing and beta reading their books, but they need better people. This felt like a sloppy draft that hadn't been edited to make it readable.",,,1,0
